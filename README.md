# Welcome to the ratchet github page for ugh!
This bot, one of Alex's random side projects, is developed in Python because Python is friendly.
## Here are some general tips
The default prefix is []. For example, you can use []help to get the link to this page. Also you can't change the prefix because I'm lazy.

## General Commands
### []greet, []hello, []hi, or []hey
say hi to the bot :D
### []help or []commands
gives you the link to this page
### []reload
reloads an extension (don't worry about this one this is an Alex thing)

## Twice Commands
### []tzuyu, []tzuwu, []hot, []tzuyupic
gives you a pic of a very special someone
